- query/classification building client
- documentation
- assemblyline blob storage

## Important
- worker loss detection/task timeout

## Nice to have/performance
- add config flag to tune filter memory use
- add SSE for search progress
- add tracing
- keep a cache of which indices are assigned to what worker
- task retry
- result/error submit retrying
- use more single value structs for better build time error detection
- pyi files
- worker that runs without downloading the entire filter file
- native azure blob store
